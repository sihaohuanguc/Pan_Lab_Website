## Why you need this
Although you may not be able to write Python scripts yourself or you don't have the demand to do that, you may still need to run some software, packages, home-made scripts from papers which are written in python. Usually the run will fail if you just run it directly without any preprations. It's good to know how to solve the error information and make the script run.

## Run a Python script
Usually an OS has python as a default, so in order to run a python script in the terminal, just do
```
python some_script.py
```
If it works, congratulations! You could go to the next page, bye-bye!
